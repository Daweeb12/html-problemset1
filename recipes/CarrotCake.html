 <h2>What is in the cake?</h2>
 <ul>
<li> <b>Sugars</b>: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting
</li>
<li><b>Oil</b>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor</li>
<li><b>Eggs</b>: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together</li>
<li><b>Vanilla</b>: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
<li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
<li><b>Leaveners</b>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
<li><b>Cinnamon</b>: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
<li><b>Salt</b>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
<li><b>Carrots</b>: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
<li><b>Pecans</b>: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
<li><b>Butter</b> and<b> cream cheese</b>: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li> 
 </ul>  



 <h2><b>Directions</b></h2>
 <ol>



 
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.</li>

  in flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into the prepared pan.</li> 
  
  <li> in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let
  cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
  
  <li>To make the frosting: Beat butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a large bowl
